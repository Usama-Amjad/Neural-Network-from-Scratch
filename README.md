# Neural_Network_from_Scratch_in_TensorFlow
Welcome to Neural Network from Scratch in TensorFlow! In this project, we learned how to implement a Neural Network model in TensorFlow using its core functionality (i.e. without the help of a high level API like Keras). We also implemented the gradient descent algorithm with the help of TensorFlow's automatic differentiation. While it’s easier to get started with TensorFlow with the Keras API, it’s still worth understanding how a slightly lower level implementation might work in tensorﬂow, and this project will give a great starting point for the same.
